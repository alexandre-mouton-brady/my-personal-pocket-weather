# My Personal Pocket Weather App

### The project

This project was created to showcase on my personal portfolio. The goal was to surf on the **single page application** wave and uncover a **virtual dom library** to manage real time data flow using a **public API** and render it as fast as possible, as well as using a **module bundler**.

I chose **inferno** for the dom renderer. A react-like virtual dom that is focused on performances. For the public API, I went with **Yahoo's public API** because they are more complexe to use than the famous **Open Weather API**. I liked the challenge of using their SQL Like Queries. Finally, for the module bundler, I chose **fuse-box**. This might not be your usual Webpack but it gets the job done much faster and is really easy to set up for virtual dom libraries.

### Technologies used

* Inferno.js (Virtual Dom library)
* Fuse-box.js (module bundler)
